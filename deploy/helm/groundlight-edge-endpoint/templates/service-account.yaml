# To securely interact with the Kubernetes API from within a pod,
# Kubernetes uses a system called Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
# When the Kubernetes Python client inside any pod tries to access
# the Kubernetes API, it needs to get auntheticated and authorized
# to access Kubernetes resources inside the cluster.
# Specifying a service account and a cluster role with full access
# to all resources in the cluster is the simplest way to do this.
# (i.e., any pod using the `edge-endpoint-service-account` will have
# full access to all resources in the cluster.)

# For more on RBAC, see:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/
